Study Case: Fibonacci Sequence Calculator

Background: Youâ€™re tasked with creating a Python program that generates the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (starting with 0 and 1).

Requirements:

Create a Python program with two files: main.py and fibonacci.py.
In fibonacci.py, define a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit.
In main.py, read user input for the desired sequence length (number of terms).
Call the function from fibonacci.py to generate the sequence.
Display the sequence to the user.
Steps:

Main Program (main.py):
Ask the user for the desired sequence length (e.g., "Enter the number of Fibonacci terms: ").
Call the function from fibonacci.py.
Display the generated sequence.
Imported Module (fibonacci.py):
Define a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence.
Use a loop or recursion to calculate the sequence.
Export this function to be used in the main program.
Example: Suppose the user enters:

Desired sequence length: 8
The program should generate and display the first 8 terms of the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.
